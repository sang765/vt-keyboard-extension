# VT Keyboard Extension

A browser extension that modifies the behavior of the Enter key on virtual keyboards to create new lines instead of submitting forms, with support for both Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge) and Firefox.

## Features

- **Smart Enter Key Handling**: Converts Enter key presses to new line insertions in text areas and input fields
- **Whitelist Management**: Only activates on user-specified websites for better control
- **Search Field Exclusion**: Automatically skips search inputs to maintain expected behavior
- **Cross-Browser Support**: Works on both Chromium and Firefox browsers
- **Persistent Settings**: Whitelist stored using browser sync storage
- **User-Friendly Options**: Simple interface to manage whitelisted domains
